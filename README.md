##about 
i wrote some of the quotes in the script. than to have other user to make their own quotes i made a button and a function and i styled the button. thats why the button is green.

##inspiration
when people are sad they can just go on this wedsite and read some inspirational  quotes and even write quotes of their own it can lift them up a bit 

##design
for the background i wanted it to be flowers and i wanted everything to be mathing. but without the sheer white you couldnt really see the text very well so lizzy help me put the sheer white.

##code
than for the code i used CSS, html, and JavaScript. 
i made a button with htlm and styled it with CSS. than i programmed it with JavaScript. when you click on the button calls a function. my add a quote function promts the user for a quote. and stores their quote as a variable.then i add their quote to the array of quote that i wrote. then i wrote a for loop that loops though each quote in the array and posts on the website.

for the background i wrote code using background-image and i linked the image to the code.
